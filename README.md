MenuHotkeys is a "simple" Geometry Dash mod that uses the geode modding framework. It aims to add hotkeys to *most* of the games menu, so that you can use your keyboard to navigate the whole game, no need for a mouse!

The mod isn't perfect, and there are still probably a lot of things I could add keybinds for. not to mention, the code is pretty messy in general (please dont look at the helpers 😭). I will absolutely continue to work on this mod.

If you have a specific thing you want a keybind for, you can either make an issue here, or hit me up on [Twitter](x.com/baconmaniagd) or Discord @notbaconmania. (or you could always just fork the repo and add the keybind yourself

Features:

-Hotkeys for almost every menu button in game, the game should be fully playable with just the keyboard now!

-Every key can be rebound via settings>options>keys.

-When you open the level search menu, it lets you start typing without having to click the search box.
